# The Storytelling Data Scientist's Journey Through Financial Markets
## Welcome to My Exploration: A Non-Coder's Odyssey in Finance

Embark with me on an enlightening expedition into the heart of financial markets. Without a traditional background in coding, I've taken the leap, guided by the transformative power of technology and the insightful analysis possible through language learning models such as ChatGPT.

### Project Overview

This endeavor seeks to unravel the intricate web of financial markets, presenting discoveries in a manner accessible to all. Within these pages lie scripts, analyses, and the wisdom I've garnered from navigating the realms of stocks, bonds, commodities, and beyond, all through the eyes of a self-taught aficionado armed with AI and machine learning.

### What Awaits You

- **Analytical Scripts:** Journey through Python scripts and notebooks designed to dissect market data.
- **Data Visualizations:** A visual feast of charts and graphs, elucidating market trends and patterns.
- **Project Updates:** Regular dispatches on new discoveries, enhancements, and the path forward.

#### Learning Notes: Maybe?
I feel these are very personal. Maybe a few note-branches from my Obsidian? That would imply translation of my notes? Maybe that could be a ML project for the future.

### Motivation

This journey is more than a foray into financial analysisâ€”it's a crusade to dismantle the barriers within tech and finance, making technical knowledge both accessible and affordable. By documenting my odyssey, I aim to illuminate the path for those who may find themselves intimidated, encouraging them to redefine their goals and embark on their own adventures.

### How to Join the Adventure
